## 🧭 Overview

**TaskMaster** is a robust backend system built with **Java** and **Spring Boot** that facilitates organization and productivity within teams.  
It allows users to create, assign, and track tasks, collaborate through comments and attachments, and manage projects efficiently.  
The system is built on a **secure, stateless authentication model** using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
